1. basic operation

2. use and train classifiers 

---

## Basic operation

- turn the color channel from RGB to gray scale

- split the RGB picture into three respectively one color channel

- use build-in method to split image into three channel, the intensity of each color channel can be seen as gray scale image

- slice the image

---

## Picture manipulation

using pillow or cv2

- change pixels of cretain area and color channel of an image

- crop the image

- flip the image

- put text into an image

---

## Image transformation

- adjust the brightness and contrast of an image

- threshold an image and turn into black and white image

- create histograms calculating pixel value intensity

---

## Geometric operation

- try to add or multiply image pixels by noise array

- use a matrix to modify an image

- rotate the image

- resize an image

- move the image horizontally

---

## Spatial operation

- get the edge of objects in the image

- use median blur, gaussian blur to filter noise out

- use a kernel to filter noise and blur the image

- use a kernel and build-in function to sharpen the image

- use a build-in function to threshold the image and turn into balck and white image

---

## Image classification

- use KNN, SVM, logistic regression, softmax, HOG SVM model to classify images of cats and dogs and check the confusion matrix of each methed
